# Completed-Data-Structures
Since the beginning of 2023, I've embarked on a journey to learn and master the fundamental data structures crucial to computer science and software development.

**So far I've mastered the design and implementations of**
* Singly LinkedList
* Doubly LinkedList
* Stack (via LinkedList implementation)
* Queue (via LinkedList implementation)
* HashMap (Linear Probing for Collision Handling)
* HashMap (Separate Chaining for Collision Handling)
* Binary Search Tree
* AVL Tree (Self Balancing Binary Search Tree)
* Min Heap (Iterative and Recursive implementations) ~~(via Binary Search Tree implementation)~~ now using list
* Max Heap (Iterative and Recursive implementations) ~~(via Binary Search Tree implementation)~~ now using list
* Graph (Directed and Undirected)
  
**Coming Up / In progress**
* Tries
* Red Black Tree

The language I am using is Python.
