# Completed-Data-Structures
Since January 2023, I've been on a dedicated journey to learn and master the core data structures essential in computer science and software development.

So far
* Singly LinkedList
* Doubly LinkedList
* Stack (via LinkedList implementation)
* Queue (via LinkedList implementation)
* HashMap (Linear Probing for Collision Handling)
* HashMap (Separate Chaining for Collision Handling)

Coming Up
* Binary Search Tree
* AVL Tree (Self Balancing Binary Search Tree)
* Min Heap (via Binary Search Tree implementation)
* Max Heap (via Binary Search Tree implementation)
* Graph
